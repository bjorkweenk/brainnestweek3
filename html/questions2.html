        <p>3. What is an array? </p>
        An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
        <p> 4. What are arrays useful for? </p>
        In coding and programming, an array is a collection of items, or data, stored in contiguous memory locations,
        also known as database systems . The purpose of an array is to store multiple pieces of data of the same type
        together.
        <p> 5. How do you access an array element? </p>
        To access an individual element of an array, use the name of the array name followed by the index of the element
        in square brackets. Array indices start at 0 and end at size-1: array_name[index]; accesses the index'th element
        of array_name starting at zero.
        <p> 6. How do you change an array element? </p>
        Use the indexOf() method to get the index of the element you want to replace. Call the Array. splice() method to
        replace the element at the specific index. The array element will get replaced in place
        <p> 7. What are some useful array properties? </p>
        filter, reduce, slice, sort, every and for each
        <p> 8. What are some useful array methods? </p>
        filter, reduce, slice, sort, every and for each
        <p> 9. What are loops useful for? </p>

        The continue statement terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled
        loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.
        <p> 12.What is the DOM? </p>

        The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It
        defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
        <p> 13.How do you target the nodes you want to work with? </p>
        <p>14.How do you create an element in the DOM? </p>
        <p>15.How do you add an element to the DOM? </p>
        <p> 16.How do you remove an element from the DOM? </p>
        <p> 17.How can you alter an element in the DOM? </p>

        <p> 21.What are three ways to use events in your code? </p>
        <p> 22.Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events? </p>

        <p> 23.What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners? </p>
        <p> 24.How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes? </p>
        <p> 25.What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and

        <p> 26.What does a “nodelist” contain? </p>
        <p> 27.Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.
